I call this one, the campfire song song.
Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song.
Our -c-a-m-p-f-i-r-e- -s-o-n-g- song.
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster than you're wrong, 
but it'll help if you just sing alooong.
Bum, Bum, BUMMMMMM...
[Patrick attempts to sing along with spongebob.]
[Spongebob goes off here.]
-c-a-m-p-f-i-r-e- -s-o-n-g- song.
-c-a-m-p-f-i-r-e- -s-o-n-g- song,
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster than you're wrong,
But it'll help if you just sing alooong.
-c-a-m-p-f-i-r-e- -s-o-n-g- song,
Patrick!
Patrick: Song! -C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E!
Squidward!
Squidward: [says nothing because depression mode activate]
Spongebob:
Good!
It'll heeeelp, it'll heeeeeelp, if you just sing aloooooong!
[Spongebob smashes his perfectly good guitar 
in anger of squidward not helping with singing.]
[Patrick, consumed by jealousy of spongebobs perfect singing voice, 
tries to destroy spongebob with the drums he played earlier.]
[Patrick is flabbergasted at how not only spongebob survived, 
but was able to pop out without a scratch. His mission failed, he'll get'em next time.]
OHH YEAA!!!
